# Mood Insight App (MVP)

A minimal mental health support app designed to help users understand  
**what conditions affect their mood** — both negatively and positively.

This project is built from a lived-experience perspective, focusing on:
- Chronic fatigue
- Sleep issues
- High sensitivity (HSP)
- Low self-esteem

Rather than trying to "fix" emotions, the app helps users **recognize patterns**
and build their own personal “user manual”.

## 🌱 Core Concept

This app does NOT aim to:
- Force positive thinking
- Push productivity
- Judge or analyze the user

Instead, it focuses on:
- Understanding **conditions**, not causes
- Reflecting *after* mood changes (no prediction pressure)
- Being usable even on low-energy days

---

## ✨ Features (MVP)

### 1. Daily Mood Logging
- Simple mood score: `-2 / -1 / 0 / +1 / +2`
- One-tap input
- Neutral days require no extra action

### 2. Condition Tracking
Depending on the mood score:
- **Negative mood** → track possible warning signs
- **Positive / stable mood** → track supportive conditions

Conditions are grouped into:
- Body
- Sensory stimulation (HSP-friendly)
- Mind
- Small behaviors

No free text, no obligation to select anything.

### 3. Weekly Insights (Planned)
- Mood trends
- Frequently associated conditions
- Pattern visualization (no advice, no judgment)

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Low cognitive load
- Minimal UI
- No “you should” language
- No streaks, no pressure
- Rest days are valid data
